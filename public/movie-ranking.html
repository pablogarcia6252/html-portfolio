<h1>Top movies according to me</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 favorite movies (kinda)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dawn of the dead (2004)</h3>
<p>I love terror and action movies. It's a perfect combination of them, all the time you are scared and with adrenaline at 100% of action.</p>
<h3>Spiderman 2</h3>
<p>I've been loving super heroes all my life, who else doesn't? This is the top of superheroes movies.</p>
<h3>Wild hogs</h3>
<P>Another thing I love not just in movies is comedy, I make jokes all the time. Funny and motorcycles, what else can I ask?</P>
